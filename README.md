Grade 10 Type Racer Project

WARNING: 
This code may not work due to the fact that backspace.txt is not set up properly.

When I was making this in grade 10, I could not figure out a way to delete a letter on the console,
so I tracked my backspace press, and saved it to backspace.txt. While exporting this file though,
I think I broke the code unfortunately :(.

However the main idea is still there. It is threaded type racer game, where the console updates the words in live
time and your key presses are tracked accordingly. It should be thoroughly commented, so please enjoy!
